## GPT-4 Chatbot UI

Build your own GPT-4 chatbot frontend with this open source Next.js template! Simply add your OpenAI API key as `OPENAI_API_KEY` and you're good to go!

Don't have early access to GPT-4? Replace `gpt-4` with `gpt-3.5-turbo` in `pages/api/chat.js`.

## Getting Started

Hit the run button to start the development server.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on `/api/chat`. This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/chat.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
